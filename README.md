# Math Utility Library

A lightweight **Java** library for basic geometric operations.

The library provides multiple classes for different mathematical entities:

- Vectors (`Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4`)
- Integer Vectors (`IntVector2`, `IntVector3`, `IntVector4`)
- Square matrices (`Matrix2`, `Matrix3`, `Matrix4`)
- Quaternions (`Quaternion`)
- Rays (`Ray`)
- Planes (`Plane`)
- Transforms (a vector and a quaternion) (`Transform`)

The library is unfinished and some math functions may not work as intended.
